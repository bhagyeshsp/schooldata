Certainly! Let's break down the concept of nested resources in a Rails application and how it all fits together with forms, controllers, models, and routes. We'll take it step-by-step to build an intuitive understanding.

### 1. Concept of Nested Resources

In a Rails application, nested resources represent a hierarchical relationship between models. In your case, a `Teacher` has many `Students`. This relationship is reflected in the way routes and paths are structured.

### 2. Routes Configuration

First, let's look at how you configure nested routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :teachers do
    resources :students, only: [:new, :create]
  end
  # other routes
end
```

In this setup:
- `resources :teachers` generates routes for `Teacher` actions (index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy).
- `resources :students, only: [:new, :create]` nested inside `resources :teachers` means that students are always created in the context of a specific teacher.

### 3. Path Helpers

Rails generates path helpers based on the routes. For nested routes:
- `new_teacher_student_path(@teacher)` generates the path to the form for creating a new student under a specific teacher.
- This path includes the teacher's ID, e.g., `/teachers/1/students/new`.

### 4. Controllers

In the controller, you need to handle this nested relationship:

```ruby
# app/controllers/students_controller.rb
class StudentsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_teacher, only: [:new, :create]

  def new
    @student = @teacher.students.build
  end

  def create
    @student = @teacher.students.build(student_params)
    if @student.save
      redirect_to @teacher, notice: 'Student was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def set_teacher
    @teacher = Teacher.find(params[:teacher_id])
  end

  def student_params
    params.require(:student).permit(:name, :grade, :gender)
  end
end
```

Here:
- `before_action :set_teacher, only: [:new, :create]` ensures that the `@teacher` is set before these actions.
- `@teacher.students.build` initializes a new student associated with the given teacher.

### 5. Models

Your models should define the associations:

```ruby
# app/models/teacher.rb
class Teacher < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :students, dependent: :destroy
end

# app/models/student.rb
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :teacher
end
```

### 6. Views and Form Helpers

In the view, you use `form_with` to generate a form for the nested resource:

```erb
<!-- app/views/students/new.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(model: [@teacher, @student], local: true) do |form| %>
  <% if @student.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@student.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this student from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
        <% @student.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
          <li><%= message %></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= form.label :name %>
    <%= form.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= form.label :grade %>
    <%= form.text_field :grade %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= form.label :gender %>
    <%= form.text_field :gender %>
  </div>

  <!-- Add other student fields as needed -->

  <div class="actions">
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Nested Path**: `new_teacher_student_path(@teacher)`
   - Generates a URL like `/teachers/1/students/new`.
   - Includes the teacher's ID, so the form knows which teacher the student will be associated with.

2. **Form Initialization**: `form_with(model: [@teacher, @student], local: true)`
   - `model: [@teacher, @student]` tells Rails to use the nested route. Rails will look for `teacher_students_path` or `teacher_student_path` for the form action.
   - This ensures the form submits to the correct nested route, e.g., `POST /teachers/1/students`.

3. **Controller Context**: `@teacher = Teacher.find(params[:teacher_id])`
   - Before the `new` and `create` actions, the controller fetches the `Teacher` using the ID from the route.
   - `@student = @teacher.students.build` initializes a new student associated with the `@teacher`.

4. **Form Submission**:
   - When the form is submitted, it sends the data to `POST /teachers/:teacher_id/students`.
   - The `create` action in `StudentsController` uses `@teacher.students.build(student_params)` to ensure the new student is associated with the correct teacher.

### How Rails Handles This Internally:

1. **Routing**:
   - Rails parses the URL and matches it to the nested routes.
   - It extracts the `teacher_id` from the URL and passes it to the controller.

2. **Controller**:
   - The `set_teacher` method retrieves the teacher from the database.
   - The `new` action sets up a new `Student` object associated with the `Teacher`.
   - The `create` action builds the student under the teacher and saves it.

3. **Form Handling**:
   - `form_with` generates the correct HTML form action attribute, pointing to the nested route.
   - When submitted, the form data includes the `teacher_id`, ensuring the student is correctly associated with the teacher.

### Summary:

- **Nested Routes**: Define parent-child relationships in the URL structure.
- **Path Helpers**: Generate URLs that include the parent resource's ID.
- **Controllers**: Retrieve the parent resource and build the child resource in its context.
- **Forms**: Use `form_with` with nested models to generate the correct form action.

By understanding this flow, you can see how Rails handles nested resources, ensuring data integrity and proper associations between models.
